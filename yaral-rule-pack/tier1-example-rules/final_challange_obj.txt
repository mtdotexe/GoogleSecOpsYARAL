Write a YARA-L rule to detect the following suspicious multi-vector activity:


File Name:
A file is dropped with a name that starts with agent_ or ends with .injector.exe, .dropper.exe, or .stage1.exe

HTTP URI:
URI path ends with .php or .exe and contains either /sync or /task
But should not contain /safe or /test

User-Agent:
Starts with python or AutoFetcher, or ends with /3.1
But not if it contains Mozilla, Chrome, or Edge

DNS Query:
Matches domains ending in .xyz, .top, or .info
But not if it begins with cdn., static., or safe.

IP Destination:
Matches either 203.0.113.11 or 198.51.100.7

User Email:
Starts with admin@, support@, or ends with @protonmail.com, @secure-mail.org
Designed to catch phishing attempts or abuse of trusted-looking senders

Hex Pattern:
Must match: { 60 BE ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 06 FF 50 08 }

File SHA-256 hash:
Should match a known hash:
e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03abd8335c8490d7317d6d7f2342a33bc4


Bonus Techniques to Apply:

Use matches (regex) for file.name, URI, UA, DNS, email
Use contains only where necessary (e.g., /task)
Apply regex anchors (^, $) in UA, DNS, email
Apply piping | and grouping () for clarity
Use logical chaining and proper parentheses to avoid operator mistakes
Maintain clean structure and comment the rule properly
